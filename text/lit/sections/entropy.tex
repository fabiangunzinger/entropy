    \item Show that people who have a more diverse set of contacts in terms of
        the number of contacts and the geographic variation of those contacts
        tend to live in more prosperous areas, supporting the idea from
        sociology that a large number of loose contacts is associated with
        prosperity.

    \item They define diversity using entropy, calculating social diversity
        using call volumes of individual uses (p_ij is the share of i's calls
        spend talking to j) and spatial diversity using areas (p_ij is the
        share of i's calls spend talking to contacts in area j).

    \item They also use PCA to create a composite measure of diversity, which
        is even more predictive than either of the two measures combined.
