\begin{equation}
    s_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \beta H_{i,t} + \zeta X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

$s_{i,t}$ is individual $i$'s savings rate in month $t$, calculated as the
total inflow of funds in month $t$ into all savings accounts held by $i$,
divided by $i$'s estimated monthly income.

The vector of control variables, $X_{i,t}$, contains the monthly spend for each
spending category, total monthly spend across all categories, and annual income.
