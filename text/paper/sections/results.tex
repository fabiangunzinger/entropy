\subsection{Use-month level analysis}%
\label{sub:use_month_level_analysis}

In this section, we analyse results at the user-month level. Entropy measures
are calculated based on the probability of occurrence of a pattern within a
user month. Implicitly, this assumes that move diverse spending reflects more
chaotic behaviour.

The outcome variable is a dummy indicating whether a user made at least one
transfer into their savings account in a given month.

Table~\ref{tab:reg_csw0} summarises the main results.

Table~\ref{tab:reg_sw0} gives a different view of results (move to appendix).

\subsection{Use-level analysis}%
\label{sub:use_level_analysis}

In this section, we present user-level results. Entropy measures are calculated
based on basked-revealed frequenty approach discussed in
guidotti2015behavioural, as described in method section.
