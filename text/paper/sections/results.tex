\subsection{Use-month level analysis}%
\label{sub:use_month_level_analysis}

In this section, we analyse results at the user-month level. Entropy measures
are calculated based on the probability of occurrence of a pattern within a
user month. Implicitly, this assumes that move diverse spending reflects more
chaotic behaviour.

The outcome variable is a dummy indicating whether a user made at least one
transfer into their savings account in a given month.

Table~\ref{tab:reg_sw0} shows controls added one at a time.

Table~\ref{tab:reg_csw0} summarises shows controls added cumulatively.

Table~\ref{tab:muggleton2020_replication} replicates results from
\citet{muggleton2020evidence} Tables S20 (Columns 1 and 2) and Table S40
(columns 3 and 4).
