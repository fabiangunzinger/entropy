\edit{Ignore this section for now. Below are just notes.}
There are a number of alternative ways to characterise spend profiles. We could
calculate profiles based on the distribution of transaction values rather than
counts. We could also calculate profiles based on inter-temporal rather than
intra-temporal distributions, focusing on consistency of purchasing behaviour
over time rather than on predictability at any given time
\citep{krumme2013predictability}. Further, we could focus on time-based rather
than category-based measures, focusing, for instance, on whether purchases of
the same type tend to occur on the same day of the week
\citep{guidotti2015behavioral}. Finally, one could also create composite
measures based on principal component analysis, an approach used in
\citet{eagle2010network}. We leave these extensions for future research.
