\subsection{Entropy components}%
\label{sub:entropy_components}

Figure~\ref{fig:entropy_components} shows the empirical relationship with our
48-categories-based unsmoothed entropy variable and these three
components.\footnote{To highlight the main features of the relationships we
have trimmed the component values at the 95th percentile.} We can see that for
the values we observe in the dataset, entropy increases monotonically in the
number of unique spending categories with positive frequency counts, has no
clear relationship with the standard deviation of those counts, and increases
in the number of total spending transactions up to about 175 transaction,
before being increasingly determined by other elements thereafter.
