\section{Additional results}%
\label{sec:additional_results}

\subsection{Endogeneity}%
\label{sub:endogeneity}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sub:estimation}, one concern one might have about
our results in Section~\ref{sec:results} is reverse causality:
transferring money into savings accounts might change the distribution of spend
categories and thus change entropy. As noted previously, this is not a major
concern because of the way we calculate savings and spend profiles: savings are
calculated as the sum of inflows into savings accounts, while spend profiles
are based on the classification of spend transactions in current accounts, and
transfers from current to savings accounts are labelled as such and not treated
as spend transactions.

However, because transaction labelling is imperfect, it is possible that some
transfers are misclassified as spends and included in the calculation of
entropy scores. One way to deal with this is to lag entropy scores by one
period. Table~\ref{tab:reg_has_inflows_lag} presents results similar to the main
results in the main text, but using entropy lagged by one year-month period as
the independent variable of interest. We can see that the results are very
similar to thos presented above.

\subsection{Further results by financial resilience}%
\label{sub:results_by_financial_resilience}

The Tables below show results presented in
Section~\ref{sub:effect_of_financial_resilience} for alternative entropy
variables.
