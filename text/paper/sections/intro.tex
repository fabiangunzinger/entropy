Literature:

\citet{muggleton2020evidence} find that consumption entropy over categories
correlates with financial distress.

\citet{davenport2020spending} study the impact of COVID-19 on the spending and
savings behaviour of MDB users.

\citet{baker2021household} summarises literature that uses mass financial
transaction data to study household financial behaviour.

\citet{becker2017does} finds that access to a fintech money management app
increases first-time savings and savings account balances among 65,000 customers
of a large European bank but that update is negatively correlated with financial
sophistication.

\citet{colby2013savings} has useful literature review on short-term savings and
suggests that subgoals can increase willingness to forego short-amounts in the
present because they move the reference point in a prospect-theory framework.

Paper:

Independent variable: entropy over categories and others

Outcome variables: first-time saving, average monthly savings
