\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

We use the following nomenclature throughout:
\begin{description}
    \item[user] individual
    \item[tag] spending category
\end{description}




Question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do people forget to save when their lives are chaotic?
\end{itemize}

Definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define a savings transaction as an inflow into any of a person's
        savings accounts.
    \item We capture the degree of chaos in a person's life using entropy.
\end{itemize}


Motivation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding what determines people's savings behviour is important
        but, to our knowledge, completely understudied.

    \item Entropy is positively correlated with negative financial outcomes
        \citet{muggleton2020evidence}
\end{itemize}

% Literature:

% \citet{muggleton2020evidence} find that consumption entropy over categories
% correlates with financial distress.

% \citet{davenport2020spending} study the impact of COVID-19 on the spending and
% savings behaviour of MDB users.

% \citet{baker2021household} summarises literature that uses mass financial
% transaction data to study household financial behaviour.

% \citet{becker2017does} finds that access to a fintech money management app
% increases first-time savings and savings account balances among 65,000 customers
% of a large European bank but that update is negatively correlated with financial
% sophistication.

% \citet{colby2013savings} has useful literature review on short-term savings and
% suggests that subgoals can increase willingness to forego short-amounts in the
% present because they move the reference point in a prospect-theory framework.
