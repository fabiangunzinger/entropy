Literature:

\citet{muggleton2020evidence} find that consumption entropy over categories
correlates with financial distress.

\citet{davenport2020spending} study the impact of COVID-19 on the spending and
savings behaviour of MDB users.

\citet{baker2021household} summarises literature that uses mass financial
transaction data to study household financial behaviour.

\citet{becker2017does} finds that access to a fintech money management app
increases first-time savings and savings account balances among 65,000 customers
of a large European bank but that update is negatively correlated with financial
sophistication.


Paper:

Outcome variables: first-time saving, average monthly savings
