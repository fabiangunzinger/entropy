\label{sub:effect_of_entropy_on_overdraft_fees}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Table~\ref{tab:reg_entropy_odfees} replicates results from
        \citet{muggleton2020evidence} Tables S20 (Columns 1 and 2) and Table
        S40 (columns 3 and 4).

    \item Similar to their results, higher entropy is positively related to
        negative financial outcomes.

    \item Yet, contrary to their findings, the effect becomes stronger in the
        presence of fixed effects.

    \item Also, in contrast to above findings, using non-smoothed entropy
        doesn't reverse the effect but strengthen it.

    \item Differences to \citet{muggleton2020evidence} could be due to a number
        of factors: we use a different dataset, a different and self-selected sample of people
        that is skewed towards younger and wealthier individuals, as well as a
        longer panel.

\end{itemize}
