\section{Abstract}

We show that spending patterns are predictive of the frequency with which
individual's make transfers into their ``emergency savings''. We capture
the variation in spending profiles using entropy, and define emergency
savings as transfers into savings accounts. The effect of spending entropy
on savings is statistically significant and economically large, and robust
across a number of different specifications and entropy measures based on
different product and merchant categories. The direction of the effect
depends, however, on the handling of categories in which individuals make
no transactions in a given month. While our results give some indication as
to how we can explain this result, further research is needed for a more
complete understanding.
