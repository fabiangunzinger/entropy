\subsection{Outcomes}%
\label{sub:outcomes}

Our main outcome variable is savings as a proportion of monthly income, where
we measure savings as the sum of all savings account inflows. For a more
nuanced understanding of how app use affects savings we also consider net-savings --
total savings account inflows minus outflows -- as a proportion of monthly
income to see whether a willingness to save more might be offset by a (later)
need to withdraw funds, and a dummy variable for whether a user has any savings
account inflows in a given month to see whether the app helps users save at
all. To investigate possible channels, we consider total spend, highly
discretionary spend, banking charges, the total amount of borrowing, as well as
payday borrowing, all as proportion of monthly income. We think of these
additional outcomes as exploratory and do not make any adjustments for multiple
hypothesis testing.\footnote{For a recent game-theoretically motivated
discussion of when and how to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, see
\citet{viviano2021should}.}

An alternative approach, based on \citet{anderson2008multiple}, would be to
group outcomes into ``savings'', ``spending'', ``borrowing'', and ``fees'', and
consider them as different dimensions of a latent variable of interest which we
might call ``financial management skills''. We do not do that for two reasons:
first and foremost, because we think it is natural to think of the amount saved
as the ultimate outcome and of other outcomes as providing a more nuanced
understanding of savings behaviour or as suggesting possible channels through
which app use affects savings. Thinking of savings as the main goal is also
reflected in Money Dashboard's main promise, which is to help users spend less
and save more, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mdb_website}. Second, as pointed out
in \citet{carlin2017fintech}, incurring overdraft fees is not an unambiguous
sign of a financial mistake, as the opportunity to go into overdraft confers a
benefit to the consumer.\footnote{For further discussions on fees, see
\citet{jorring2020financial, stango2009consumers}.}


\subsection{Analysis plan (temp)}%
\label{sub:analysis_plan_temp_}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show descriptive results (simple fig of behaviour change pre-post)

    \item Follow sakaguchi2022default (i.d. use dynamic TWFE DiD with synthetic
        control), but use sun2022estimating and the
        fixest implementation thereof to account for dynamic TWFE contamination
        issue
        \href{https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/fixest_walkthrough.html#staggered-difference-in-differences-sun-and-abraham-2020}{paper}

    \item Main results: Figure and associated table akin to
        sakaguchi2022default Figure 2 and Table 6.

    \item Subgroup analysis: same Fig an Tab as in main analysis, but with line
        for each subgroup. One figure for each of: gender, generations, income
        terciles, per-adoption average savings tercile (inspired by
        \citet{carlin2017fintech}, see Fig 5 and Table 4).

    \item Robustness check with 12 and 18 month data windows.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Difference-in-difference}%
\label{sub:difference_in_difference}

Control group design:
\begin{itemize}

    \item We only have data for a self-selected group of people who choose to
        use Money Dashboard. By virtue of signing up to an app that helps them
        manage their money, these users are different from those who don't sign
        up. As a result, we are unable to answer the question of whether use of
        Money Dashboard helps the average person in the population as a whole
        save more.\footnote{One way to get closer to that answer is to
            re-weight our sample on observable demographic variables so as to
            match the UK population as a whole. But our sample differs from the
            population as a whole both is ways that are observable (demographic
            variables) and unobservable (self-awareness that they need help
            managing their money, cognitive resources to engage with the app,
            motivation to do so). Re-weighting would only help us deal with the
        first of these.} Instead, we are answering the question whether Money
        Dashboard succeeds in helping its \textit{users} save more.

    \item Money Dashboard can access up to three years of historic data for
        each account a user links to their account.

    \item Each user for whom we have sufficient data thus serves as both a
        treatment unit and a potential control unit.

    \item We use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of
        app use. Because we do not have a separate control group, we use the
        per-signup data of Money Dashboard users as control periods and use
        matching to find comparable control user for each tretment user.

    \item To perform the matching, we proceed as follows:

    \item For treatment units, we select data for six months before and after
        signup, where the month of the signup is treated as the first of the
        six after-signup months. For each user, we then calculate the mean
        value of each covariate for the pre-signup period.

    \item We construct potential control units as all 12-month data windows we
        observe before signup, and for each potential control unit calculate
        the mean value of each covariate for the first six months.

    \item We use matching proceedure introduced in \citet{ho2007matching} and
        implemented in the \textit{MatchIt} R-package \citep{stuart2011matchit} to
        find most similar comparison unit for each treatment unit.

    \item Matching method:

\end{itemize}

Estimating treatment effects
\begin{itemize}

    \item Our estimate is the ATT, not the ATE. 

    \item First, we present pre and post signup comparisons without matching
        (i.e. control group is user pre-signup).

    \item Second, we present (static) pre-post using matched comparisons.

    \item Third, we present dynamic pre-post using matched comparisons. Need to
        think about how this relates to \citet{sun2021estimating}, who propose
        an unbiased estimator for dynamic two-way FE event study designs. I
        think our analysis nests theirs, since we might still want to include
        fixed and time effects, though I need to think about this. (Reason to
        do so: we won't be able to match perfectly, so including user and time
        fixed effects to control for unit and time invariant variation still
        seems useful).

    \item As alternative to matching, consider synthetic controls for
        disaggregated data \citep{abadie2021penalized}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Difference-in-difference analysis}%
\label{sub:difference_in_difference_analysis}

\subsection{Subgroups}%
\label{sub:subgroups}

To analyse which groups benefit most from adopting Money Dashboard, we split
our sample by gender, generation, income quartiles, and pre-adoption savings
behaviour.

We define generations as follows: boomers were born between 1946 and 1964, Gen
X between 1965 and 1980, Millennials between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z after
1997.\footnote{Based on age ranges provides by
