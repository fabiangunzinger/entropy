\subsection{Outcomes}%
\label{sub:outcomes}

Our main outcome variable is savings as a proportion of monthly income, where
we measure savings as the sum of all savings account inflows. This is a natural
measure to focus on since Money Dashboard's main promise is to help users spend
less and save more, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mdb_website}.  Furthermore,
while different users will have different motivations for using the app, it is
reasonable to assume that for many, these motivations ultimately boil down to
an increase in savings (which could include, as a first step, a reduction in
debt).

For a more nuanced understanding of how app use affects savings we consider
net-savings -- total savings account inflows minus outflows -- as a proportion
of monthly income to see whether a willingness to save more might be offset by
a (later) need to withdraw funds, and a dummy variable for whether a user has
any savings account inflows in a given month to see whether the the app helps
users save at all.

To investigate possible channels, we consider total spend, highly discretionary
spend, banking charges, the total amount of borrowing, as well as payday
borrowing, all as proportion of monthly income.\footnote{As pointed out in
    \citet{carlin2017fintech}, incurring overdraft fees is not an unambiguously
negative outcome, as the opportunity to go into overdraft confers a benefit to
the consumer. For further discussions on fees, see \citet{jorring2019financial,
stango2009consumers}.}

We think of these additional outcomes as exploratory and do not make any
adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing.\footnote{For a recent
game-theoretically motivated discussion of when and how to correct for multiple
hypothesis testing, see \citet{viviano2021should}.} An alternative approach
would be to group outcomes in the spirit of the approach proposed by
\citet{anderson2008multiple}. We do not do that because we think that the
amount of savings is a clear main outcome to focus on, while gropuing outcomes
is most natural in settings where multiple sets of outcomes are of equal
interest (such as outcomes of educational interventions on different student
age cohorts, as \citet{anderson2008multiple}).


\subsection{Analysis plan (temp)}%
\label{sub:analysis_plan_temp_}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show descriptive results (simple fig of behaviour change pre-post)

    \item Follow sakaguchi2022default (i.d. use dynamic TWFE DiD with synthetic
        control), but use sun2022estimating and the
        fixest implementation thereof to account for dynamic TWFE contamination
        issue
        \href{https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/fixest_walkthrough.html#staggered-difference-in-differences-sun-and-abraham-2020}{paper}

    \item Main results: Figure and associated table akin to
        sakaguchi2022default Figure 2 and Table 6.

    \item Subgroup analysis: same Fig an Tab as in main analysis, but with line
        for each subgroup. One figure for each of: gender, generations, income
        terciles, per-adoption average savings tercile (inspired by
        \citet{carlin2017fintech}, see Fig 5 and Table 4).

    \item Robustness check with 12 and 18 month data windows.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Descriptive analysis}%

\subsection{Difference-in-difference}%
\label{sub:difference_in_difference}

\subsection{Subgroups}%
\label{sub:subgroups}

To analyse which groups benefit most from adopting Money Dashboard, we split
our sample by gender, generation, income quartiles, and pre-adoption savings
behaviour.

We define generations as follows: boomers were born between 1946 and 1964, Gen
X between 1965 and 1980, Millennials between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z after
1997.\footnote{Based on age ranges provides by
