Ideal data interface:

- SQL database containing entire dataset that I can selectively pull users and
  columns from.

- Would eliminate need to process different samples (just process full dataset
  and store date in db, then pull from there as needed)


Disadvantages / stuff I'd need to figure out:

- Hosting db on AWS

- Refactor preprocessing pipeline
