# Entropy scratchpad

## Meaning of entropy

- The assumption of our entropy calculation is that spending on a larger set of
  mcs indicates a more chaotic lifestyle. We use user-month data, so

- The finding that higher entropy predicts higher financial distress (in
  muggleton2020evidence) says that months in which people spend money on a
  larger set of mcs are predictive of financial distress later on. We interpret
  spending on more mcs as indicative of a more chaotic lifestyle. Our
  motivating mechanism is that a more chaotic lifestyle is associated with
  impaired cognitive function, which, presumably, is associated with poor
  financial outcomes.

- Chain is: diverse spending - more chaotic lifestyle - impaired cognitive
  function - poor financial outcome.
