# Entropy scratchpad

## Entropy and savings

- muggleton2020evidence (ME) seem to conflate chaotic behaviour and chaotic
  environments. 

  - vernon2016predictors assesses the effect of 'household chaos' on
  development in children, where household chaos is captured by
  10 factors out of which 7 are non-behavioural factors.

  - mittal2015cognitive focus on 'childhood unpredictability', which is based
  on three factors which are only partially related to behaviours.

  - hirsh2012psychological is a theory paper.

  - frankenhuis2016cognitive is also a theory paper, and explicityly focuses on
  environmental unpredictability.





## Meaning of entropy

- The assumption of our entropy calculation is that spending on a larger set of
  mcs indicates a more chaotic lifestyle. We use user-month data, so

- The finding that higher entropy predicts higher financial distress (in
  muggleton2020evidence) says that months in which people spend money on a
  larger set of mcs are predictive of financial distress later on. We interpret
  spending on more mcs as indicative of a more chaotic lifestyle. Our
  motivating mechanism is that a more chaotic lifestyle is associated with
  impaired cognitive function, which, presumably, is associated with poor
  financial outcomes.

- Chain is: diverse spending - more chaotic lifestyle - impaired cognitive
  function - poor financial outcome.
